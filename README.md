Java Coding projects I worked on during my foundation year at Heriot-Watt University Malaysia (2022-2023).
These were some of the earliest coding projects I worked on, and do not including the smaller practice projects I worked on individually to practice code (these are found on my gitlab, linked in my "Nashawiyat" repsoitory).
- Hangman2 is a creative twist on the Hang-man game. It was a group project we worked on to practice the basics of coding and OOP.
- HappyFarm2 is a fun software to spawn different animals (which we created using Java library shapes), allow them to hover around the window
  and click and drag them around. Also was a group project which tested our software design and understanding and use of J-Frame and Java Swing for GUI.
